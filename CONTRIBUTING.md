# Contributing
Contributions of all types are welcome.
We use GitHub as our bug and feature tracker both for code and for other aspects of the library (documentation, the wiki, etc.).


## Asking Questions
The best way to ask general questions is to send an email to our mail given in profile.


## Filing issues
When in doubt, file an issue. We'd rather close a few duplicate issues than let a problem go unnoticed.<br>
Similarly if you support a particular feature request, feel free to let us know by commenting on the issue.

To file a new issue, please provide details as much as possible.<br>
The more information you can provide, the more likely we are to be able help.


## Contributing code
Pull requests are welcome for all parts of the codebase.<br>
You can find instructions on building the project in [README.md][5].<br>
feel free to put up your pull request anyway.
